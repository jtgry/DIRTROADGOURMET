If you like buffalo hot wings, you will love this spicy blend of chicken, cream cheese, and cayenne pepper sauce. This dip is delicious with chips or celery sticks! Keep it hot during the game or party in a crock-pot. Or you can heat this right on the grill while the burgers and hot dogs are cooking!

**How To Prepare:**

1. Remove all wrappings, including top.
2. Place pan in oven.
3. Bake 60 - 65 minutes on 350 or until internal temperature is 165.
