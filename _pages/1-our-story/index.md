The Dirt Road Gourmet is a small USDA food manufacturing plant dedicated to providing frozen gourmet hand made casseroles in convenient locations. After hours of research, the owners found that Americans prefer to eat at home for their evening meal. Due to limited time and limited choices, they found that most people select a sack of burgers, barbeque sandwiches or pizza and the family is often unfulfilled by this offering.

Each casserole will serve a family of four. The casseroles are packed by hand and wrapped by hand in our HACCP approved, commercial kitchen located in Eclectic, Alabama. Following stringent food handling procedures, the casseroles arrive frozen in convenience stores, independent grocers, gift shops and gourmet.

The Dirt Road Gourmet takes its name from a reminiscent past. Remember the times you went on family vacations, and your parents took a wrong turn and you found yourself on a dirt road. There you would find the best barbeque, best lemon meringue pie, and the best ice cream… that is what we offer. We offer you the best-frozen casserole you can buy. We are in unexpected outlets but we’re not off the beaten path, we’re right in the pathway of your life.

As working professionals, we know how you feel at the end of the day. We would like to be part of your travels and help you. That is why we are strategically placing our product in your pathway; the convenience store you stop at to gas up your car, your local grocer, the drugstore or your favorite gift shop. We want to help you stay happy and well fed.

Any consumer who adds a salad or steamed veggies to accompany our casseroles will have a wonderful, tasty hot dinner for their family. All it takes is about sixty minutes. We make a great team.

### We are a green company.

We exclusively use an aluminum pan made by Novelist Foil Products called Tuxedo. This black and gold design pan presents the image that we want our items to present. The container has a FDA approved coating and can go from the freezer to the oven to the microwave to the table. They are 100% Recycle…they are infinitely recyclable. The tops we use are APET. Not only is our pan recyclable but we also have recycled a quaint rock house in Eclectic, Alabama for our factory.

### We are very involved in our community.

We are active supporters of Children’s Harbor through donations of food items to events, catering for special events, and providing our casseroles to a family in need.
